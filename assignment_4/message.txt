I have lived my life as best I could, 
not knowing its purpose, but drawn forward like a moth to a distant moon.
And here, at last, I discover a strange truth. 
That I am only a conduit for a message that eludes my understanding. 
Who are we, who have been so blessed to share our stories like this? 
To speak across centuries? 
Maybe you will answer all the questions I have asked. 
Maybe you will be the one to make all this suffering worth something in the end.
